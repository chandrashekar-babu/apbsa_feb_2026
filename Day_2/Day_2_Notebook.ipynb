    "\n",
    " - Daemon Threads are automatically terminated when there are no more Active Threads alive in a python process. A daemon thread can be created by setting the ```daemon=True``` argument while constructing the Thread class, or setting the ```.daemon``` attribute to True to a Thread instance before the thread's ```.start()``` method is invoked.\n",

    "##### Common use-cases for Daemon Threads\n",

    " 1. Caution must be exercised if a daemon thread should be use resources managed by active threads. For example, reading from files which could be closed by active threads can lead to runtime errors in daemon threads that could not be gracefully handled.\n",
